* TODO:
  - Test expand and restrict method in the Lattice class.
    + The current issue is line 292. loc is np.ndarray and we cannot
      reliably check if it belongs to pts_inherited(list).
* Progress
  - <2020-09-15 Tue 19:16>
    + Reorganized the repo
    + Replaced Point class with np.ndarray. (I think this is cleaner)
    + Shift tested
